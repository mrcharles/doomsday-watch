# A Somewhat Filtered Doom Firehose

It's hard to find all the good doom (tech, climate, music), without accidentally drinking from the bad doom (war, politics). If you are one of those weirdos like me that needs to avoid the latter, but cannot get enough of the former, then do please enjoy my minimal editorial link-dump blog.

I'm Charles Randall and I've been yelling about a lot of this stuff since before it was cool, and I've watched things continue to get worse in a predictable fashion. So now I find it cathartic to see it happening in real time.
