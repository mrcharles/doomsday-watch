  <h2 id="tech-doom">Tech Doom</h2>
<h3 id="ai">AI</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/are-we-watching-the-internet-die/">long read about the death of the internet</a> is excellent. Some real great quotes in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who rely on generative AI to create are not creators any more than a person that commissions a portrait is an artist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying that user-generated content will <em>disappear,</em> but that human beings cannot create content at the scale that automation can, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai?ref=wheresyoured.at">when a large chunk of the internet is content for robots</a>, <em>that</em> is the content that will inform tomorrow&rsquo;s models. The only thing that can truly make them better is <em>more stuff</em>, but when the majority of stuff being created isn&rsquo;t good, or interesting, or even written for a human being, ChatGPT or Claude&rsquo;s models will learn the rotten habits of rotten content. This is why so many models&rsquo; responses sound so similar — they&rsquo;re heavily dependent on the stuff they&rsquo;re fed for their outputs, and so much of their &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; comes from the same training data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different flavor of the same problem — these models don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;know&rdquo; anything. They&rsquo;re copying other people&rsquo;s homework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever found yourself wondering how you can argue against AI-assisted coding tools, or really any forced usage of AI-assisted tools for any creative endeavor, <a href="https://qntm.org/assist">this piece by qntm</a> helped solidify some of my thoughts and opinions into concrete reasons why these tools are not valuable. tl;dr: you&rsquo;ll spend as much time validating and fixing their output as if you simply did the work yourself&hellip; and doing the work yourself is fundamentally more satisfying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And as it&rsquo;s currently positioned, AI coding assistance seems like an addition, but it actually removes the human from a part of the process where the human was actually extremely valuable. When a human writes code, we have the original programmer to vouch for their code, plus another person to review and double-check their work. With AI assistance, we don&rsquo;t get that first &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the vein of providing you concrete arguments to use against AI proponents, <a href="https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/">this article about the similarities between psychic cons and how AI is pitched to people</a> is a wonderful dive into common grifter tactics and how the tech community is using the same patterns with AI.</p>
<p>Rounding it out is <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/bubble-trouble/">another article from Ed Zitron</a> who calls out that the AI boom, as it&rsquo;s currently positioned, is entirely unsustainable. And just to prove it, here&rsquo;s an article about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/stability_ai_bills/">Stability AI being unable to pay their bills</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Models like ChatGPT and Claude are <em>deeply</em> dependent on training data to improve their outputs, and their very existence is actively impeding the creation of the very thing they need to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironically, OpenAI&rsquo;s best hope for survival would be to fund as many news outlets as possible and directly incentivize them to do in-depth reporting, rather than proliferating a tech that unquestionably harms the media industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="boeing">Boeing</h3>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a stretch to call it tech, but the way Boeing is being run into the ground is clearly the same pattern of every tech company so it counts. So have a <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-03-28-suicide-mission-boeing/">chilling read about how Boeing&rsquo;s been cutting corners</a>, and then have a nice follow up where the primary <a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2024-03-14-strange-death-boeing-whistleblower/">whistleblower apparently committed suicide</a>. And as a fun non-April edition, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/02/second-boeing-whistleblower-dies">second Boeing whistleblower died</a> after a sudden illness.</p>
<h2 id="climate-doom">Climate Doom</h2>
<h3 id="global-warming">Global Warming</h3>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/apr/09/tenth-consecutive-monthly-heat-record-alarms-confounds-climate-scientists">new heat record</a> right? Also, I should have assumed that increased heat would cause water to expand a notable amount, but I <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/flooding-sea-level-rise-gulf-coast/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzE0MzYzMjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzE1NzQ1NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MTQzNjMyMDAsImp0aSI6IjU4NjRmNGRjLTJiYTItNDRiZS1iZTE5LTMzYWNiZTY2ZThjZCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9jbGltYXRlLWVudmlyb25tZW50L2ludGVyYWN0aXZlLzIwMjQvZmxvb2Rpbmctc2VhLWxldmVsLXJpc2UtZ3VsZi1jb2FzdC8ifQ.OfWJgBu-6RJGpDUux7a7Wp9azfRWUoy0ewRIJBCnr_Y&amp;itid=gfta">hadn&rsquo;t considered what this would mean</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is sitting idly by, I just hope the people who are engaging in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/climate/global-warming-clouds-solar-geoengineering.html?unlocked_article_code=1.qU0.Rk0a.1oG8mQhV_xIX&amp;smid=url-share">geoengineering experiments</a> understand that the cost for a major roll out of geoengineering is always going to be a massive risk to human health.</p>
<p>One small win however is the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68768598">European Court of Human Rights ruling that climate inaction has violated human rights</a>. Would love to see more of this, and I&rsquo;d love even more if this stuff ever had teeth. Time will tell I suppose, but I&rsquo;m not holding out hope.</p>
<h3 id="fracking">Fracking</h3>
<p>If you know people from northern Alberta or British Columbia, you&rsquo;ve probably heard stories about how bad things are up there with respect to oil companies and ecological damage. Well, the amount of earthquakes caused by fracking <a href="https://thetyee.ca/News/2024/04/26/Fracking-Quakes-Have-Surged-Fort-St-John/">continues to increase</a>.</p>
<h2 id="misc-nightmare-fuel">Misc Nightmare Fuel</h2>
<p>Have you ever looked at some tile and thought you saw a face? <a href="https://johnhawks.net/weblog/how-many-bathrooms-have-neandertals-in-the-tile/amp/">Maybe you did.</a></p>
<h2 id="please-distract-me-from-this-hell">Please Distract Me From This Hell</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fun video where you get to see Brent Hinds continue to be a complete burnout while Bill Kelliher continues to carry a presentation about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IHeyHX4HLc">Mastodon&rsquo;s 11 heaviest riffs</a>.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s <a href="https://derrickanthonyvella.bandcamp.com/album/i-hardly-knew-me">a wonderful solo fingerstyle folk album</a> from a guy better known for extreme metal (Derrick Vella from Tomb Mold / Dream Unending);</p>
